# Understand-TypeScript: Drag and Drop

This is a practice project followed from the Udemy course [Understanding TypeScript](https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript/).

In this project, I learned how to use TypeScript to build a drag and drop project.

## How to run

You need: [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run project:

```bash
pnpm start
```

To make changes and start compiling TypeScript, open another terminal and run:

```bash
pnpm dev
```
